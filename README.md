# Bill-Hubert-Personal-Website

Here is a personal Webpage I developed from earlier in my coursework.  It is created exclusively with HTML and CSS...no JavaScript or any other language/library.  For the layout, I used a combination of CSS Flexbox, Grid and Bootstrap.  It is a work in progress but feel free to check it out!
